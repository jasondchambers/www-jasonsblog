In this article, I share my experiences managing difficult projects. If you are faced with fixed dates and scope, as an Engineering Leader or Project Manager, I share you how I navigated through this situation and yet somehow still managed to deliver with predictability and quality.

For some projects, you can often get by with just enough planning and you leave the door open for adjusting as you execute the plan. Adjustments are in the form of flexing either or both the schedule and scope. For other projects, you might be faced with strict deadlines forcing you to fix the dates. This at least gives you some wiggle room to flex the scope as you execute the plan.

The most challenging types of projects are where the dates are fixed, and the scope has been reduced to the bare bones. This leaves no margin for error and therefore exposes the project to significant risk. This is what is known as the [“Iron Triangle”](https://ambysoft.com/essays/brokentriangle.html). What might you do in such a situation?

You might be tempted to add more people to the team. Assuming there is budget available, this approach is unlikely to work in the short-term and is likely to further slow progress.

If you have performed capacity planning and rough-sized all essential work and the work still doesn't fit, you should work with your Product Management partner and fully explore if there is further scope that can be cut. You should also explore if there is some flexibility on the dates. It may be worth working with the teams to revisit the estimates and explore maybe if there are some trade-offs that can be made or cheaper options to explore to accelerate. This could a slippery slope and either impact quality and/or the user experience.

If all options have been explored, the risk profile for the plan remains high and so this needs to be communicated to the stakeholders. The greatest risk is arguably the impact to the teams in terms of morale, burn-out and potential attrition.

As a leader, you can take this environment as a constraint and work with it.

"Iron Triangle" Survival Guide

THe following are guidelines for improving delivery predictability, maintaining quality and keeping the teams together when faced with the "Iron Triangle".

1 - Improve Planning Discipline. As you execute the project, you need to rely on early indicators that the project is going off the rails. For the first quarter cycle, we discovered quite late that the project was running off the rails.
