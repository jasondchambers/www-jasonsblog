When evaluating candidates [¹], I urge you to look beyond the skills of the candidate. Of course, skills are an important consideration, but know that skills can be learned and the skills you need today may not be the skills you need tomorrow.

Ask yourself, are you looking to release a product? Meet deadlines? Or, are you looking to build a sustainable, productive organization where people bring their all and who will follow you wherever you go?

If the former, then maybe consider getting a contractor. If the latter, then maybe consider giving someone a chance. After all, didn’t someone give you a chance when you got started? Know that no-one is ready for a particular role. If you insist on 100% skill match and 100% readiness, you are casting yourself a very small net. Look for curiosity, character, intelligence. Someone who has endless capacity to learn and to grow.

So, assume you follow these suggestions and now you are dealing with a skills gap. This is very easy to solve. Maybe consider people who have been around a bit. Maybe don’t be dismissive of candidates just because they are of a similar age to your parents. They will help guide you during difficult challenging times when your back is against the wall. In this role, look for someone who is a gifted teacher who is willing and able to share their vast wells of experience and wisdom.

Something to think about. I know people on both sides of the spectrum I can connect you with.
